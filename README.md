# ChatKinsey
## Description
This app is a chat bot aimed at candidates for strategy consulting firms.  
It is currently deployed at this address: [chatkinsey.vercel.app](https://chatkinsey.vercel.app).

## Stack
* Next.js
* TypeScript
* OpenAI API
* P5.js (for animation)

## Key features
### üîê Security
The OpenAI API key used in this project is protected by the new `Edge rundtime` feature of Next.js, allowing to write backend code directly in a Next.js project, and deploy it easily on the edge.  

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Responsiveness
The text responses coming from the OpenAI API are streamed in real time to reduce delay. This technique was particularly challenging to implement as it is not well documented.

### üé® Aesthetic
The background animation reacts to the user input, it uses trigonometry and replicate an element of the firm's visual language.
